=========================

* Deployment Improvements
  - E-mail summarizing the changes that have been deployed
  - Log with all deployment actions for future analysis
  - DB migrations improved

** Dev is deployable
  - Dev is used for testing
  - UAT is finally used for User Acceptance

* Workspaces
  - Made possible by workspaces
  - Every developer has a private workspace (on shared dev server)
  - Can work on different topics on the same products
  - Can try out changes during core review
  - Seems simple but implementation is very clever
    - To get around TYPO3 limitations

* Git
  - Much faster than SVN; almost 0 turnarond while developing
  - Saner development model where changes are contained
    - Changes can have much better documentation
  - Successful migration and training of 8 people

* Code Reviews
  - Made possible by Git usage
  - Make changes more solid when in testing stage
  - Introducing a more even transparent way of working
    - Work in progress can be reviewed as it happens
	- Less "ah if only I realized before..."
	- Require a close team

* DB Throwaway
  - Requested by testers for automatic tests
  - Used as intended
  - Freeze the user data
  - Run tests that change the data
  - Revert all changes
  - Fast running of tests on UAT without breaking BU work
  - TODO: use for automated security tests

* KN Portal Upgrade
  - Tons of bugfixes after live release

* Microsites Upgrade
  - Tons of bugfixes
  - Literally tons of bugfixes
  - First relese failed; I joined before second attempt
  - Second attempt succeeded
    - Optimized some migration processes
	- Optimized database operations

* osat
  - Open source tool I wrote to fix DB ops
  - Used successfully on Microsites
  - Also used for Extranet
  - http://github.com/dullgiulio/osat

* sys-file-indexer
  - Open source tool in free time
  - TYPO3 scanner is damn slow (3 hours for Extranet)
    - KNet will take 24 hours? Not acceptable
  - Much faster, will take 12 minutes for Extranet
  - Used smartly, can take seconds at actual go-live
  - Parallel code written in Go:
    - http://github.com/dullgiulio/sys-file-indexer
  - Will probably need a server version to use on KNet after upgrade
   - On KNet files are uploaded a way TYPO3 doesn't support

* perso
  - Needed by testers for automated tests
  - Can access outgoing email in test systems
  - Server has been running continuously for 8 months without problems
    - Doesn't need maintenance
  - Also Open Source in free time:
